# Menu Bar Splitter Privacy Policy

Menu Bar Splitter doesn't collect any data. The only data it stores is to save your preferences for your dividers.

The app makes use of a helper app titled "Menu Bar Splitter AutoLaunch" which runs at login to start the app automatically, and nothing else. It is also bundled with a Bartender Compatibility Version that lets you use it with the menu bar organization app. These helper apps only run if enabled by the user.

If using the Bartender Compatibility Version, the app makes use of the DistributedNotificationCenter in only one situation: closing the Bartender Compatibility Version when disabling it or quitting the app.

This app is completely open-source, and you can look at the source code for the it and the bundled helper apps [here](https://github.com/jwhamilton99/menu-bar-splitter/tree/master).
