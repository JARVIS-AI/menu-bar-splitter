# Menu Bar Splitter Privacy Policy

Menu Bar Splitter doesn't collect any data. The only data it stores is to save your preferences for your dividers.

The app makes use of a helper app titled "Menu Bar Splitter AutoLaunch" which runs at login to start the app automatically, and nothing else.

This app is completely open-source, and you can look at the source code for the it and the bundled helper apps [here](https://github.com/jwhamilton99/menu-bar-splitter/tree/master).
