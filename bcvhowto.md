# How To Use Bartender Compatibility Mode

![hero](/img/sc3.png)

Menu Bar Splitter includes a Bartender Compatibility Mode, which lets you use the app with the fantastic menu bar organizer [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/).

Bartender lets you have 2 levels of menu bar: one hidden, and another shown when a button is pressed. You can set which apps are shown in which level, so you can have one group of splitters shown, while another is hidden:

You can add as many splitters in both the main app as well as the Bartender Compatibility Version.
