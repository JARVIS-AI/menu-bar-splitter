Download the app [here](https://github.com/jwhamilton99/menu-bar-splitter/releases).

**Note for Bartender users**: If you want to have dividers in both levels of menu bar, there's a Bartender compatibility version of MBS. I couldn't figure out how to make it work with one app, so just run both versions and set one to be hidden.

Sorry this is so convoluted.
