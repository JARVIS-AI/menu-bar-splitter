# Menu Bar Splitter

A simple macOS app to help keep your menu bar organized by adding dividers that you can move between icons. You can add as many dividers as you need, rearrange them as you please (CMD+Click+Drag), and choose between 4 different icons for each divider.

(Apparently it requires Catalina and I didn't realize. Sorry about that.)

**Note for Bartender users**: If you want to have dividers in both levels of menu bar, there's a Bartender compatibility version of MBS. I couldn't figure out how to make it work with one app, so just run both versions and set one to be hidden. Sorry this is so convoluted.
