A simple macOS app to help keep your menu bar organized by adding dividers that you can move between icons. You can add as many dividers as you need, rearrange them as you please (CMD+Click+Drag), and choose between 4 different icons for each divider.

**Note**: Version v1.1 will be released on the Mac App Store soon. The latest release hosted here, v1.0.1, is an old version and is different from the source code. I'll update the readme with a Mac App Store link when it's available.

New:

* Bundled the main app and BCV into a single app

* Added a checkmark next to the currently selected icon in the menu

Changed:
