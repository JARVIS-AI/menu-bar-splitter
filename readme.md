# Menu Bar Splitter

A simple macOS app to help keep your menu bar organized.

(Apparently it requires Catalina and I didn't realize. Sorry about that.)

**Note for Bartender users**: If you want to have dividers in both levels of menu bar, there's a Bartender compatibility version of MBS. I couldn't figure out how to make it work with one app, so just run both versions and set one to be hidden. Sorry this is so convoluted.
